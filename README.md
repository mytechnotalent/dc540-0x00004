## BRIEF
Bets Fielding received a communication from the Five Eyes facility in Alice Springs, Australia that there was a Reverse Engineer that had helped them in the past to assist the DC540 Team in getting into the Dark Eyes facility by hacking the 1337 Gate firmware.

Bets delighted with the news advised Field Marshall Baab Fortune and he ordered a secure flight to which Bets Fielding and the mysterious entity known only as Z, who is the DC540 Shellmancer, to meet this Reverse Engineer in person and get transport to the Dark Eyes facility in a classified location in Siberia, Russia.

Dr. Emery Riddle, "The Cipher", was able to intercept an official Dark Eyes document, `Адрес.png`, to which he passed along to the team.

Bets and Z arrived at the Alice Springs facility to meet the Reverse Engineer and in he walked wearing a blood-red robe and cape.  Bets and Z introduced themselves and he said, I am Arvinator.  I am from a hidden island kingdom that no nation knows about.  We have the most superior Cyber capabilities and evade even the most sophisticated SIGNIT satellite capabilities as we exist on no map!

Bets coordinated with the Alice Springs team to prepare transport to the Dark Eyes facility immediately.  Bets, Z and Arvinator boarded the transport and arrived at the Dark Eyes 1337 gate.  

Z noticed the security cameras and immediately begin searching for a way to patch into them and hijack the footage to play an infinite loop to the Dark Eyes security team monitoring the cameras.  After three hours, Z was able to compromise the cameras and the team began Reverse Engineering the `1337бэкдор.uf2` firmware.

After 77 straight hours, Arvinator was able to crack the 1337 gate firmware!  Immediately the gate opened and the team proceeded to Sector 42 to begin their recon.

One of the guards did notice them as they entered the hallway and Bets was able to snap his neck within 1.337 seconds so that he made no sound or alert to the facility.  

Upon arriving in Sector 42, they noticed another Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to which was connected to a monitor which read, "Human System Overlord".  After inspection, the team figured out it was an industrial control system which controlled the alarm, lights and oxygen levels in Sector 42.

## MISSION
You have been selected by the DC540 ANGELS OF DEATH to be the Reverse Engineer on this mission. Your task is to review the attached `capture.png`. `Адрес.png` and find an exploit to turn off the alarm and lights without disabling the oxygen and convert the `ПовелительЧеловеческойСистемы.uf2` to a .bin binary to begin reverse engineering. Your mission is to flash a Raspberry Pi Pico with the `ПовелительЧеловеческойСистемы.uf2` firmware and see how it operates. Convert the file to a .bin file to bring into Ghidra and properly reverse engineer it and report the flag back to, "The Architect" with your results by sending a private Discord DM to Kevin Thomas.

## HINT
"You will know you have the flag as it will end with, `k1llz`"
